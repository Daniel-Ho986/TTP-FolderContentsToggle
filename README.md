Folder Contents Toggle

- Write a Folder component that displays the name of a folder called 'Home'.
- Under the folder there should be three files in an unordered list: 'File1', 'File2', 'File3'.
- Add a button that toggle the visibility of the files on the screen everytime it is clicked.
- eg: Initially the folder and files are all on the screen, but when the "Toggle' button is clicked the files disappear, then when it is clicked again, the files reappear.
